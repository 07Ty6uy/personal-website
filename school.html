                I have stayed in East Lansing ever since I started school. First 
                was Pinecrest Elementary (now called Green Elementary), MacDonald
                Middle School, and now East Lansing HighSchool. I also partake 
                dual enrollment at LCC, hoping to transfer credits to MSU to
                study for Computer Science.
