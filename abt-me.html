            <p id="job-text">
                I began working when I was 17. My first ever job was Dollar General.
                I made only $10.33 an hour working there, with little hours.
                However, it definetly helped me in getting work experience, and 
                knowing what working was like. After leaving there, I began to work
                at Culver's. As my first time working fast food, and making a lot more
                money than I did before, this is where I am currently settled. I also
                decided to work at NCG, since my friend worked there, and I figured I 
                could work there was well, and make more money. But I didn't like working
                there, with very boring work, and constantly being sent home, I decided
                to leave working there, and stay at Culver's, making $13 an hour, after previously
                making $12 an hour before I turned 18.
